## Prompts used to create this project:
```sh
# Prompt 1:
Build a fully functional and responsive web application called **Internal Newsletter Content Generator**. This tool will help HR or DevOps teams generate polished monthly or quarterly internal newsletters from raw departmental updates.

### Features to Implement:

#### 1. Frontend (User Interface)
- A clean and modern UI with the following:
  - A large `<textarea>` for users to paste raw text input (departmental updates, announcements, achievements).
  - A **"Generate Newsletter"** button to submit the input for processing.
  - A read-only `<textarea>` or styled content block to display the generated newsletter.
  - A **"Copy to Clipboard"** button to copy the final draft.

#### 2. Backend (Content Generator)
- A backend service (Node.js with Express or Python with Flask) that:
  - Accepts a POST request with the raw input and selected newsletter type.
    - Clean up and organize the raw input.
    - Generate a professional, well-structured newsletter draft.
    - Include the following sections where appropriate:
      - **üìå Key Highlights**
      - **üèÜ Team Achievements**
      - **üìÖ Upcoming Events**
      - **üì£ Announcements**
    - Improve grammar, tone, formatting, and structure.
    - Output content in either markdown (based on implementation).

#### 3. Prompt Design for AI (Backend usage)
- Include the following when prompting the AI model:
  - "You are an expert communication writer helping HR generate internal newsletters."
  - "Take the following raw departmental notes and generate a structured, engaging newsletter."
  - "Organize into logical sections with clear headers."
  - "Use a friendly but professional tone suitable for a company-wide internal audience."
  - "Improve grammar, clarity, and formatting."
  - "Return the result in markdown or HTML."

#### 4. Technologies to Use
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or vue.js).
- Backend: Node.js with Express (or Python with Flask).
- Deployment-ready (can run locally or deploy to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, or Render).

#### 5. Bonus (Optional)
- Export the newsletter as a downloadable **PDF**.
- Simple email preview or "Send Test Email" option.

### Final Notes:
- Ensure code is modular, clean, and well-commented.
- Use a minimal yet professional UI layout (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or custom CSS).
- All functionality should work in a browser, and backend should expose clear API endpoints.

Build the complete application with frontend, backend, and AI integration.
you can use Gemini (Google AI) via its API to process the raw text input and generate a structured, grammatically correct internal newsletter draft. The AI should organize content under headings like "Highlights", "Achievements", "Announcements", and "Upcoming Events", and return a professional, readable newsletter using a friendly tone.
